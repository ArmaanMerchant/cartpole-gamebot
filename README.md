# cartpole-gamebot
This repository contains the code for my CartPole GameBot in Python.

The code is in gamebot.py.

Run this in your terminal and make sure you have Tensorflow installed (incl. tflearn) $ pip install tensorflow or $ pip install tflearn

This is an ML application that requires training so, it can get better and better! Enjoy! 

P.S. Works on Mac, Windows and Linux.
